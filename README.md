## About python-logger-wrapper
Python-logger-wrapper is a customized python logging module mainly for logging down exceptions.

### How to install
Simply copy&paste `Logger.py` to where you can import properly

### How to use
```python
from logger import log, Logger

# Without params
@log
def hello():
	pass

# With params
@log('This string is something you wanna log down before the following function is executed', level='debug')
def hello():
	pass

# Use Logger as
def hello():
	logger = Logger('/')
	logger.info('hello '+ 'world!')
```
Log will be generated under `*/log` folder with name of generated date (%Y-%m-%d).

### How to Customize
The python-logger-wrapper provides 5 variables for your own customization.
Defaults:

```python
_is_debug = True # If debug is true, then messages will be printed out on the terminal also. And messages with level about debug will be logged down.
_print_format = '%(name)-6s: %(levelname)-6s %(message)s' # The print format that will be shown on terminal.
_rotate_format = '%(asctime)s (%(levelname)s) %(message)s' # The header message
_log_file = 'log/' + str(date.today()) # The fullpath of log file
_logger_name = 'Your Log' # Log name
```

Logger Class APIs:
```python
Logger(
		log_file,
		logger_name=_logger_name, 
		*,
		debug=_is_debug
		)
```
